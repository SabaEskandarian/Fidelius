# hardpass
A hardware password manager, built around a Paspberry Pi Zero and [`pass`, the UNIX password manager](https://passwordstore.org).

This is also an entry for [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io)'s Pi Zero Contest. 

This repo shall also provide code for your own hid-gadgets - the code is meant to be easy to change to suit your needs. 

## Hardware
I am using a Raspberry Pi Zero, since it has USB-OTG support and a lot of GPIO to interface an OLED screen, a button matrix for input and maybe even an ESP8266 for WiFi. 
The OLED I am intending to use has an IÂ²C interface and a screen diagonal of .96". 

## using the driver
The neccessary drivers are available only in the Raspbian 4.4 Kernel, which you can install using
```
sudo BRANCH=next rpi-update
```
You also need to activate the device tree overlay `dwc2` and load the corresponding kernel module:
```
echo "dtoverlay=dwc2" | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt
echo "dwc2" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

To use this program, you have to enable the `libcomposite` driver on the Raspberry Pi and create a USB HID gadget. 
You can use this bash script:
```
#!/bin/bash
# this is a stripped down version of https://github.com/ckuethe/usbarmory/wiki/USB-Gadgets - I don't claim any rights

modprobe libcomposite
cd /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/
mkdir -p g1

```

## modifying `pass`
The version of (pass)[https://passwordstore.org] doesn't format the output as nice, so it is easier to work with. Using the `pass-installer.sh` will automatically clone from the original repository, apply the patch and install it (make sure, `patch` and `sudo` is installed). 

You can then check out `hardpass-demo.sh` to see how to supply a passphrase directly from the command line (without gpg-agent). Keep in mind, that it will show up in your history file!

## internals of this code
whenever you need to add (or remove) a new keyboard layout, the following changes have to be made:

### adding a new keyboard layout (example)
1. in `scancodes.h` add the layout to `keysym`-struct:
this identifier does not need to be used outside of scancodes.{h,c}. 
```
struct keysym {
	// ...
	struct layout de_dv; //dvorak layout
	// ...
};
```
2. the enum `kbd1` has to be ammended:
```
enum kbdl {  //keyboard layouts:
	// ...
        de_DV //de_AT-Dvorak
};
```
3. in `scancodes.c` you need to add a new column (containing more columns) to the big `keysyms[]` table:
It is suggested to explicitly name `.is_dead` and `.unicode` to avoid confusion. Also notice that `.is_dead` is part of the layout (and goes within the inner braces), while `.unicode` resides in the keysym-struct. 
if you want to add new keys, the following must be kept in mind: `toscan()` will use the nth line of the table, if n is larger than 32 (aka. will use the ascii code to look up chars). symbols not in the 7-bit ascii standard can be put on the first 32 positions as utf-8 encoded strings, although keeping [0] to the release all chars is recommended. (some text editors will convert files to older encodings - this might break things)
```
struct keysym keysyms[] = {
	//...
	{"#", {0x20, 0x02}, {0x31, 0x00}, {0x31, 0x00}, {KEY, MODIFIER}},
	{"^", {0x23, 0x02}, {0x35, 0x00}, {0x35, 0x00}, {KEY, MODIFIER, .is_dead = 1}},
	{"&", {0x24, 0x02}, {0x23, 0x02}, {0x23, 0x02}, {KEY, MODIFIER}, .unicode=OxHEX},
	//...
};
```
4. `tolay()` needs a new case to its switch statement:
This is the only place where the `layout`-idenitfier from `keysym` needs to be used. 
```
struct layout* tolay (struct keysym* s, enum kbdl layout) {
        switch (layout) {
	// ...
        case de_DV: return &(s->de_dv);
        default: return NULL;
        }
}
```
5. finally, your code must understand the new layout, represented by the `enum kbd1`-entry, `de_DV` in this example.
