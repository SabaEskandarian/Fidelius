# Hardpass OLED menu

Some experiments in displaying menus on the Pi via an i2c OLED screen. 

This uses the ArduiPi_OLED library from http://hallard.me/adafruit-oled-display-driver-for-pi/

Please follow the link above on how to install the library on the pi. 
Compilation of all the files was done on the Pi Zero, Raspbian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie) and Kernel 4.4.6
